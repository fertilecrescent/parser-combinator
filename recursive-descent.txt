You are given context free grammar
A recursive descent parser is a top-down parser
    Which means it starts with the start symbol
A *predictive parser* is a special case of a recursive
    descent parser in which *no backtracking* is required
Predictive parsers can only be written for LL(k) grammars
    -Which means there is a constant k such that the parser
    -only has to look at the next k tokens of input (never more)
This exclueds *ambiguous grammars* and grammars with *left recursion*
Any context free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent
    grammar which has no left recursion
A predictive parser runs in *linear* time
You write a function for each rule of the grammar
The resulting program looks like the grammar
